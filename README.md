Modern Work Flows final assignment

The European Values Study is a large-scale, cross-national and longitudinal survey research program on how Europeans think about family, work, religion, politics, and society. Repeated every nine years in an increasing number of countries, the survey provides insights into the ideas, beliefs, preferences, attitudes, values, and opinions of citizens all over Europe. As previous waves conducted in 1981, 1990, 1999, 2008, the fifth EVS wave maintains a persistent focus on a broad range of values.
Questions are highly comparable across waves and regions, making EVS
suitable for research aimed at studying trends over time. Fifth wave (EVS 2017) includes data and documentation of altogether 37 participating countries. The target population is defined as: individuals aged 18 or older (with no upper age limit) that have address of residence (not residential) in [country] within private households at the date of beginning of fieldwork (or in the date of the first visit to the household, in case of random-route selection).

Plot allow user to see the impact of the selected categories of sex and education on the  plot. Multiple regression model analysis conducted to analyze the relationship between two selected dependent variables and independent variables (age, sex, education).
